 Some tools that use regular expressions support so-called "extended" regular expressions. For example, GNU 'grep' with the '-E' option uses extended regular expressions. Other tools like 'sed' only support "basic" regular expressions. As a consequence, one must be careful in selecting the right regular expression syntax. Which of the following characters have a special meaning in extended regular expressions, but not in basic regular expressions. That is, which of the following is an extended regular expression "meta-character", but only a regular character in basic regular expressions?
    A. ^
    B. [
    C. +     ###
    D. *
